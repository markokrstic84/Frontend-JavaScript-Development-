		<p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely on the pioneering work<br>
		of the English physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years.<br>
		The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph<br>
		(AT&T), making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had<br> 
		their own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's<br>
		own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to<br>
		greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
